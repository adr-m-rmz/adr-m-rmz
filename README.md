👋 Hi, I’m Adrián Ramírez

👀 I’m passionate about the world of data. I enjoy uncovering actionable insights from data, creating compelling visualizations to communicate findings, and developing business recommendations based on data.

🌱 I’m currently learning how to develop machine learning models.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with a company where I can continue learning and contribute my skills and knowledge.
